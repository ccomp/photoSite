				I spent two weeks in Europe when I was 16 in a classical music high school group from Colorado called the Colorado Ambassadors of Music. We spent time in England, France, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and Austria, playing classical and American repertoire. The whole experience felt like a dream.

				A year before my parents got separated, my family celebrated their 20th anniversary by going to Japan. The sheer amount of culture shock I experienced here is indescribable. The moment my family stepped off the plane, I felt the influence of Japanese culture on the way I acted. Everyone seemed busy and determined. The airport had an integrated mall, not just airport stores like you find back in the US. And everything was spotless. Due to all that, it felt like I had to act a certain way.

				My most recent significant trip was to the Czech Republic. My mom and I agreed to do a mission trip there, sponsored by Cherry Hills Community Church and some larger church entity. I used to be a devout Christian, paying attention to every action to see if it appeased God. I realized in high school that I was not living how I wanted to, however. Although I said I was a Christian at the time of agreeing to this trip, I was not one to the fullest extent of the word. I was spiritual, yes. I also believe that there is some higher being(s) that could control the very essence of reality. Thus, the idea of a God existing was not far fetched to me.

				My mom and I traveled with a group of missionaries from Cherry Hills. They were certainly friendly, warm, and outgoing, and attempted to engage me in religious talk when they could. The Czech Republic is a beautiful country, with a beautiful, lush countryside, sophisticated Gothic architecture in Prague, and stoic, yet almost optimistic Communist architecture in Havirov where the mission was.

				I spent the summer before college in Jackson Hole, Wyoming with my aunt, uncle, and cousin. I worked the entire time as a bellman/valet at a mountain resort called the Teton Mountain Lodge and Spa. On my off time, I explored nature: Snow King, Yellowstone, the Teton Mountain Range, and more were explored.

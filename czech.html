				I spent two weeks in Europe when I was 16 in a classical music high school group from Colorado called the Colorado Ambassadors of Music. We spent time in England, France, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and Austria, playing classical and American repertoire. The whole experience felt like a dream. The photos can be found <a href="euro.html">here</a>.

				I spent the summer before college in Jackson Hole, Wyoming with my aunt, uncle, and cousin. I worked the entire time as a bellman/valet at a mountain resort called the Teton Mountain Lodge and Spa. On my off time, I explored nature: Snow King, Yellowstone, the Teton Mountain Range, and more were explored. The photos can be found <a href="jackson.html">here</a>.

				A year before my parents got separated, my family celebrated their 20th anniversary by going to Japan. The sheer amount of culture shock I experienced here is indescribable. The moment my family stepped off the plane, I felt the influence of Japanese culture on the way I acted. Everyone seemed busy and determined. The airport had an integrated mall, not just airport stores like you find back in the US. And everything was spotless. Due to all that, it felt like I had to act a certain way. The photos can be found <a href="tokyo.html">here</a>.

			<p>My most recent significant trip was to the Czech Republic. My mom and I agreed to do a mission trip there, sponsored by the Cherry Hills Community Church in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.</p>

			<p>My mom and I traveled with a group of friendly missionaries from Cherry Hills. The Czech Republic is a beautiful country, with a lovely, lush countryside, sophisticated Gothic architecture in Prague, and stoic, yet almost optimistic Communist architecture in Havirov where the mission was.
